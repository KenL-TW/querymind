# QueryMind Engineering Handover

## What is active

QueryMind is a governed AI data-query application. Production is the Cloudflare Worker runtime in `cloudflare/`, not the legacy Python/Nuxt/AWS implementation. Its entry point is `cloudflare/src/index.ts`; the static application is `cloudflare/public`.

## Where to find key components

| Concern | Location |
|---|---|
| Policy and EffectiveScope | `cloudflare/src/lib/query-policy.ts`, `scope.ts`, `schema-catalog.ts` |
| Worker routes | `cloudflare/src/routes/` |
| APP/DATA migrations | `cloudflare/migrations/app`, `cloudflare/migrations/data` |
| Semantic Registry | `semantic-*.ts`, `routes/semantics.ts` |
| P2-D suggestions | `semantic-intelligence*.ts`, `semantic-suggestion-*.ts`, `routes/semantic-suggestions.ts` |
| AI configuration | `ai-config.ts`, `runtime-config.ts`, `production-runtime-contract.json` |
| Tests | `cloudflare/tests/*.spec.ts` |
| Deployment and rollback | `cloudflare/PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md` |

## Current release

- Production Worker: `5c55b16b-4a02-4fb4-8906-687f1b6387ab`
- Rollback Worker: `31693496-e2b8-4110-92d6-40f61035f182`
- APP migrations: `0001`–`0010`; DATA: `0001`
- Current semantic state: registry version 0; no assets, revisions, reviews, or suggestion runs
- Release evidence: [P2-D manifest](releases/manifests/p2-d-production.json)

## Local and release workflow

```powershell
cd cloudflare
npm ci
npm run check
npm run test:db:init
npm run test:all
npm run release:preflight
```

The D1 initializer is disposable and local. D1 migrations are explicit, reviewed operations; Worker deployment must not execute them. For deployment, run the production runbook, then `npm run deploy:production`. For a rollback, use the recorded Worker version; do not roll back forward D1 migrations.

## What comes next and what is forbidden

P2-D manual production generation smoke remains pending. P2-E is not started and needs its own authority design. P2-F is not started.

Do not add LLM-based authorization, direct `QUERYMIND_DATA` execution, full-schema exposure before EffectiveScope, runtime semantic consumption, AI semantic approval, AI-generated row policy, or write-enabled AI SQL.

The old FastAPI/Nuxt/PostgreSQL/AWS stack is **LEGACY / HISTORICAL REFERENCE** only.
